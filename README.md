where weight is given in kilograms (kg) and height is given in metres (m).

## Problem description

Write a function named bmi which takes weight and height parameters and returns the corresponding BMI. Also write a main program that reads the user’s weight and height from the console, passes the entered values to the bmi function to perform the computation, obtains the function’s return value, and then prints a message to the console that reports the user’s BMI.

Here is an example of how the program’s console output might look. Green text was entered by the user;
blue text came from data returned by the bmi function.
